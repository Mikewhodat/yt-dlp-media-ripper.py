# yt-dlp-media-ripper.py
Python script that automates media downloads with yt-dlp, creating a local virtual environment if missing. Supports batch URLs from a TXT file , audio-only (WAV), video, or merged MP4, with optional subtitles. Organizes output into audio, video, and subtitle folders for clean, structured storage.

![Tor Integration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tor-Enabled-green.svg)GhostTube is a privacy-focused Python script that automates searching DuckDuckGo for YouTube content and downloading media (audio, video, or transcripts) using yt-dlp. It routes everything through Tor for anonymity, with automatic identity rotation every 10 downloads to evade trackingâ€”perfect for users who want to stay off Big Brother's radar without doing anything shady.Coded identity switching through Tor: The script automatically rotates your Tor identity every 10 downloads to boost anonymity and evade potential tracking. Note that initial setup is requiredâ€”install Tor (pkg install tor in Termux), start the daemon (nohup tor -f $PREFIX/etc/tor/torrc > tor.log 2>&1 &), and uncomment the two key lines in the torrc file to enable the control interface: ControlPort 9051 (opens port 9051 for Stem to send rotation signals) and CookieAuthentication 1 (enables secure local cookie-based auth for those signals). You can do this manually with Nano (nano $PREFIX/etc/tor/torrc, then jump to lines 57 and 61 with Ctrl+_, delete the leading # on each, save with Ctrl+O/Enter, and exit with Ctrl+X), or via sed commands (sed -i '57s/^#//' $PREFIX/etc/tor/torrc and sed -i '61s/^#//' $PREFIX/etc/tor/torrc)â€”but the script now automates this process (including torrc edits and daemon launch) in Termux/Android environments for seamless one-click operation.Tested on Termux (Android) as of October 03, 2025â€”runs headless, no root needed. Your ISP sees only Tor traffic, not your downloads.FeaturesPrivacy-First: All searches and downloads proxied through Tor; auto-rotates circuits every 10 downloads.
Smart Search: Uses DuckDuckGo (via Tor) to find YouTube videos, filters to 10 results max.
Flexible Downloads: Audio (MP3), video (MP4), both, or transcriptsâ€”your call.
Organized Output: Saves URLs to urls.txt; media in output/{type}/{sanitized_query}/.
Auto-Setup: Handles venv, deps (yt-dlp, requests[socks], stem), and Tor in Termux.
Error-Resilient: Graceful fallbacks for flaky Tor or failed downloads.

Quick Start (Termux on Android)Install Dependencies:

pkg update && pkg install python tor nano sed
pip install requests[socks] stem yt-dlp  # Or let the script handle it

Run the Script:

chmod +x ghosttube.py
./ghosttube.py

Enter a query (e.g., "lofi beats").
Choose download type (1=Audio, 2=Video, 3=Both).
Watch it search via Tor, rotate identities, and download.

The script auto-checks/sets up Tor (installs if missing, edits torrc, launches daemon). If it fails, manual fallback: See Tor Setup (#tor-setup) below.Usage

./ghosttube.py

Step 1: Prerequisites (auto-runs Tor setup, installs deps).
Step 2: Enter search query â†’ Gets 10 YouTube URLs via Tor DDG search.
Step 3: Saves URLs to urls.txt.
Step 4: Pick options â†’ Downloads with rotation every 10 (logs old/new IPs for verification).

Example output:

[INFO] Rotating Tor identity...
  Old IP: 185.220.101.108
  New IP: 2001:67c:289c:2::36
  âœ“ Identity changed: True

Tor Setup (Manual, if Auto Fails)Tor is key for privacyâ€”your ISP can't snoop content. In Termux:Install: pkg install tor
Edit torrc (uncomment lines 57 & 61 for control port):Nano: nano $PREFIX/etc/tor/torrc â†’ Ctrl+_ â†’ 57 â†’ Delete # â†’ Repeat for 61 â†’ Ctrl+O/Enter â†’ Ctrl+X.
Or Sed: 

sed -i '57s/^#//' $PREFIX/etc/tor/torrc
sed -i '61s/^#//' $PREFIX/etc/tor/torrc

Start: pkill tor && nohup tor -f $PREFIX/etc/tor/torrc > tor.log 2>&1 &
Verify: netstat -tlnp | grep 905 (both 9050 & 9051 should listen). Test IP: curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 https://ident.me

Logs: tail -f tor.log (look for "Bootstrapped 100%" and "Opening Control listener").TroubleshootingTor Connection Refused: Restart daemon; check torrc lines aren't commented.
Slow Downloads: Tor latencyâ€”normal on mobile; try WiFi.
No Results: DDG blocks some Tor exits; rotate manually (renew_tor_identity() in script).
Deps Fail: Run pip install --upgrade pip in venv.
Windows/macOS: Manual Tor install (e.g., Homebrew brew install tor); script adapts paths.

Privacy NotesTor hides your activity from ISPs/sites, but:Use HTTPS everywhere.
Rotate often for bulk downloads.
Legal: Fine for personal use; respect YouTube ToS.
